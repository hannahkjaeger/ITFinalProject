### Ingredients
```
1 cup dry quinoa (3 cups cooked)
1 bunch Tuscan kale (also labeled as Lacinato kale, dinosaur kale, or cavolo nero)
15-ounce can chickpeas
1/4 cup finely chopped shallot (or red onion or green onion)
1 bell pepper
2 carrots
1/4 cup olive oil
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 small pinch curry powder*
1 large garlic clove, peeled and grated
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt plus fresh ground black pepper to taste**
```
### Instructions

1. **Make the quinoa:** Go to Stovetop Quinoa or Instant Pot Quinoa. Make it in advance OR if serving immediately, bring the quinoa to room temperature: spread it in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze it for 2 to 3 minutes until it cools.

1. **Prep the kale**: Chop the kale. Sprinkle the kale with 1 pinch kosher salt. Coat your hands with a few drops of olive oil and massage the kale leaves for 2 to 3 minutes until all pieces are tender.

1. **Prep the other veggies:** Finely chop the onion or shallot. Dice the pepper. Peel and dice the carrots.

1. **Mix the dressing:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, curry powder, and grated garlic.

1. **Mix the salad:** Mix the quinoa and vegetables together with the dressing and the 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Add more kosher salt to taste. Stores up to 3 days refrigerated (you may need to add a pinch of salt before serving since it looses saltiness over time).
